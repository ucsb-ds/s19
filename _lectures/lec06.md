## Anscombe's Quartet
[Anscombe's Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet), developed by F.J. Anscombe in 1973, is a set of four datasets that have nearly the same summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, and correlation) but, when plotted, result in very different graphs.

Add the following code to a new notebook in JupyterHub and verify it for yourself (compute the summary statistics too):
```python
"""
Anscombe's quartet
==================
"""
import seaborn as sns
sns.set(style="ticks")

# Load the example dataset for Anscbombe's quartet
df = sns.load_dataset("anscombe")
df

#######
# Show the results of a linear regression within each dataset
sns.lmplot(x="x", y="y", col="dataset", hue="dataset", data=df,
           col_wrap=2, ci=None, palette="muted", height=3,
           scatter_kws={"s": 50, "alpha": 1})
```

Alberto Cairo created the Datasaurus dataset "to illustrate how important it is to visualize data while analyzing it":
